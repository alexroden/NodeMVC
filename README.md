# Sherlock

### Mocha
Sherlock uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as its default testing package. An alias for its script has been added to the `package.json`, therefore in order to run the project tests enter `npm test` in the your terminal. 

#### How it works?
Sherlock's tests have been setup to run in the project's `./tests` folder, where you will find an `example` test file.
